# ALO

## Introduction

ALO a simple yet effective novel loss function with ***A**daptive **L**oose **O**ptimization*, which seeks to make the best of both worlds for question answering: in-distribution and out-of-distribution. Its main technical contribution is to reduce the loss adaptively according to the ratio between the previous and current optimization state on mini-batch training data. This loose optimization technique can be used to prevent non-debiasing methods from overlearning data bias while enabling debiasing methods to maintain slight bias learning.

## Methods Overview

### Visual QA

### Extractive QA
