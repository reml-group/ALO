# Position Bias in Question Answering

This repository provides code for the paper '[Look at the First Sentence: Position Bias in Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14602)' (EMNLP, 2020). You can train the question-answering model on synthetic datasets with various de-biasing methods. We currently provide synthetic datasets and position statistics of [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/).

## Requirements

```
$ conda create -n position-bias python=3.6
$ conda install pytorch==1.5.0 torchvision==0.6.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that Pytorch has to be installed depending on the version of CUDA. 

## Dataset

We provide five synthetic datasets.

## Train

The following example train BERT on our synthetic dataset.

```
TRAIN_FILE=dataset/squad/SQuAD-train-1st.json
OUTPUT_DIR=logs/1st_bert
make train_bert TRAIN_FILE=${TRAIN_FILE} OUTPUT_DIR=${OUTPUT_DIR}
```
### Train Baselines 
You can train two de-biasing baselines (entropy regularization, randomized position) with the following examples.

```
TRAIN_FILE=dataset/squad/SQuAD-train-1st.json
OUTPUT_DIR=logs/1st_ent_reg
make train_entropy_bert TRAIN_FILE=${TRAIN_FILE} OUTPUT_DIR=${OUTPUT_DIR}
```

```
TRAIN_FILE=dataset/squad/SQuAD-train-1st.json
OUTPUT_DIR=logs/1st_random
make train_random_bert TRAIN_FILE=${TRAIN_FILE} OUTPUT_DIR=${OUTPUT_DIR}
```
### Train Bias Ensemble
The following examples train bias ensemble methods (bias product, learned-mixin) on each synthetic dataset. To select a synthetic dataset, you can choose K between [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th].

```
K = 1st
TRAIN_FILE=dataset/squad/SQuAD-train-${K}.json
STAT_FILE=dataset/squad/${K}_stat.p
OUTPUT_DIR=logs/${K}_prod
make train_prod_bert TRAIN_FILE=${TRAIN_FILE} STAT_FILE=${STAT_FILE} OUTPUT_DIR=${OUTPUT_DIR}
```

```
K = 1st
TRAIN_FILE=dataset/squad/SQuAD-train-${K}.json
STAT_FILE=dataset/squad/${K}_stat.p
OUTPUT_DIR=logs/${K}_mixin
make train_mixin_bert TRAIN_FILE=${TRAIN_FILE} STAT_FILE=${STAT_FILE} OUTPUT_DIR=${OUTPUT_DIR}
```

We also provide answer statistics of the full SQuAD dataset. After download full SQuAD data, you can train the bias ensemble method with the following example.

```
TRAIN_FILE=dataset/squad/SQuAD-v1.1-train.json
STAT_FILE=dataset/squad/train_answer_stat.p
OUTPUT_DIR=logs/full_mixin
make train_mixin_bert TRAIN_FILE=${TRAIN_FILE} STAT_FILE=${STAT_FILE} OUTPUT_DIR=${OUTPUT_DIR}
```
